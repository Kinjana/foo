put on a sweater
play the piano
shuffle a deck of cards
brush my teeth
play with matches
masturbate
go skiing
rub your back
pick my nose
play rock, paper, scissors
work on my jump shot
make snow angels
wash my face
drive a stick shift
wiggle my toes
look over my shoulder
weed the garden
touch my toes
floss my teeth
paddle a canoe
dance the night away
climb a ladder
shave my legs
give you a hug
take a penny
count on my fingers
be the big spoon
climb up stairs
put my hands behind my back
tie my shoes
leave a penny
iron a shirt
ride a bike
comb my hair
run with scissors
fold the laundry
put the seat down
Shut the door
put on my glasses
make guacamole
go bowling
butter my toast
hold your hand
touch my toes
fold a paper airplane
open a bottle of wine
make change for a $20
roll up my sleeves
screw in a lightbulb
build a fire
go rollerskating
play hungry hungry hippos
wash my hands
roll up the window
trim my nails
climb a ladder
throw a frisbee
go for a walk
feed myself
wash the dishes
get a glass of water
unwrap a Christmas present
clap my hands
hammer a nail
pop a champagne cork
flip a coin
bring in the groceries
walk the plank
go hiking
have a thumb war
Use a can opener
unload the dishwasher
use a food processor
dice an onion
Solve a Rubik's cube
be the little spoon
peel a banana
wrap a birthday present
